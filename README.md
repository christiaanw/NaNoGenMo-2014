Fork of the National Novel Generation Month 2014 edition [repo](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2014) containing my code and entry.

## The Goal

Spend the month of November writing code that generates a novel of 50k+ words.

## The Rules

The only rule is that you share at least one novel and also your source code at the end. More rules and information, like how to participate in above mentioned [repo](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2014).
