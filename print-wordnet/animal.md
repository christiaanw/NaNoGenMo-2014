A shortfin mako is very swift active bluish shark found worldwide in warm waters; important game fish, also known as a Isurus oxyrhincus. 

A longfin mako is similar to shortfin mako but darker blue, also known as a Isurus paucus. 

A bonito shark is common blue-grey shark of southwest Pacific; sport and food fish, also known as a blue pointed, or a Isurus glaucus. 

A requiem shark is any of numerous sharks from small relatively harmless bottom-dwellers to large dangerous oceanic and coastal species. A requiem shark is either a sandbar shark, a dusky shark, a whitetip shark, a blue shark, a blacktip shark, a tiger shark, a bull shark, a soupfin shark, or a lemon shark. 

A sandbar shark is most common grey shark along coasts of middle Atlantic states; sluggish and occasionally caught by fishermen, also known as a Carcharhinus plumbeus. 

A dusky shark is relatively slender blue-grey shark; nearly worldwide in tropical and temperate waters, also known as a Carcharhinus obscurus. 

A whitetip shark is large deep-water shark with white-tipped dorsal fin; worldwide distribution; most dangerous shark, also known as an oceanic whitetip shark, a white-tipped shark, or a Carcharinus longimanus. 

A blue shark is slender cosmopolitan, pelagic shark; blue body shades to white belly; dangerous especially during maritime disasters, also known as a great blue shark, or a Prionace glauca. 

A blacktip shark is widely distributed shallow-water shark with fins seemingly dipped in ink, also known as a sandbar shark, or a Carcharhinus limbatus. 

A tiger shark is large dangerous warm-water shark with striped or spotted body, also known as a Galeocerdo cuvieri. 

A bull shark is a most common shark in temperate and tropical coastal waters worldwide; heavy-bodied and dangerous, also known as a cub shark, or a Carcharhinus leucas. 

A soupfin shark is Pacific shark valued for its fins (used by Chinese in soup) and liver (rich in vitamin A), also known as a soupfin, a soup-fin, or a Galeorhinus zyopterus. 

A lemon shark is common shallow-water schooling shark of the Atlantic from North Carolina to Brazil and off west Africa; dangerous, also known as a Negaprion brevirostris. 

A cat shark is small bottom-dwelling sharks with cat-like eyes; found along continental slopes. 

A hammerhead is medium-sized live-bearing shark with eyes at either end of a flattened hammer-shaped head; worldwide in warm waters; can be dangerous, also known as a hammerhead shark. A hammerhead is either a shovelhead, a smooth hammerhead, or a smalleye hammerhead. 

A shovelhead is small harmless hammerhead having a spade-shaped head; abundant in bays and estuaries, also known as a bonnethead, a bonnet shark, or a Sphyrna tiburo. 

A smooth hammerhead is fished for the hides and vitamin-rich liver, also known as a Sphyrna zygaena. 

A smalleye hammerhead is fished for the hide and vitamin-rich liver, also known as a Sphyrna tudes. 

A whale shark is large spotted shark of warm surface waters worldwide; resembles a whale and feeds chiefly on plankton, also known as a Rhincodon typus. 

A sand tiger is shallow-water shark with sharp jagged teeth found on both sides of Atlantic; sometimes dangerous to swimmers, also known as a sand shark, a Carcharias taurus, or a Odontaspis taurus. 

An angel shark is sharks with broad flat bodies and winglike pectoral fins but that swim the way sharks do, also known as an angelfish, a Squatina squatina, or a monkfish. 

A thresher is large pelagic shark of warm seas with a whiplike tail used to round up small fish on which to feed, also known as a thrasher, a thresher shark, a fox shark, or a Alopius vulpinus. 

A spawner is a female fish at spawning time. 

A fingerling is a young or small fish. 

A placoderm is fish-like vertebrate with bony plates on head and upper body; dominant in seas and rivers during the Devonian; considered the earliest vertebrate with jaws. 

A fetus is an unborn or unhatched vertebrate in the later stages of development showing the main recognizable features of the mature animal, also known as a foetus. A fetus is either a monster, a baby, or an abortus. 

A monster is (medicine) a grossly malformed and usually nonviable fetus, also known as a teras. 

A baby is an unborn child; a human fetus. 

An abortus is a human fetus whose weight is less than 0.5 kilogram when removed or expelled from the mother's body. 

A zooplankton is animal constituent of plankton; mainly small crustaceans and fish larvae. 

A stunt is a creature (especially a whale) that has been prevented from attaining full growth. 

A migrator is an animal (especially birds and fish) that travels between different habitats at particular times of the year. 

A giant is any creature of exceptional size. 

An embryo is an animal organism in the early stages of growth and differentiation that in higher forms merge into fetal stages but in lower forms terminate in commencement of larval life, also known as a conceptus, or a fertilized egg. An embryo is either a morula, a blastula, or a gastrula. 

A morula is a solid mass of blastomeres that forms when the zygote splits; develops into the blastula. 

A blastula is early stage of an embryo produced by cleavage of an ovum; a liquid-filled sphere whose wall is composed of a single layer of cells; during this stage (about eight days after fertilization) implantation in the wall of the uterus occurs, also known as a blastosphere. A blastula can, more specifically, be a blastocyst. 

A blastocyst is the blastula of a placental mammal in which some differentiation of cells has occurred, also known as a blastodermic vessicle. 

A gastrula is double-walled stage of the embryo resulting from invagination of the blastula; the outer layer of cells is the ectoderm and the inner layer differentiates into the mesoderm and endoderm.
